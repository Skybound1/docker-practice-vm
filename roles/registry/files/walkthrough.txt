1) List available tags

reg ls -f localhost:5000

2) Obtain the manifest of the first image and get the digest of the config

reg manifest -f localhost:5000/supersecretimage:v1

3) Download the config and observe that a file was added to /lib/udev/docker.txt within the last layer

reg layer -f localhost:5000/supersecretimage@<config digest from manifest> | jq

4) Get the digest of the bottom layer from the manifest

5) Download the bottom layer

reg layer -f localhost:5000/supersecretimage@<layer digest from manifest> > layer.tar.gz

6) Extract layer and cat lib/udev/docker.txt

tar zxvf layer.tar.gz && cat lib/udev/docker.txt


7) For the second image, the same steps can be followed to get to the config which contains the flag

8) For the final flag, the config shows a file was added in the second to last layer and then deleted in the final, as such obtain the digest of the second from bottom layer from the manifest

9) Download the layer as before, extract and view the contents of bin/something.txt
