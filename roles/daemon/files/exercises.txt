These exercises should be done from within a shell in the "backdoor" container.

1) Access the docker daemon via the UNIX socket mounted into the container, and list running containers
2) Access the docker daemon via the TCP socket on the network, and list running containers HINT: The host is the gateway for the container
3) Using either the UNIX socket or the TCP socket, leverage the docker daemon to print out the hosts /etc/shadow file

Bonus:

4) Using either the UNIX socket or the TCP socket, break out of the container, and have a shell on the host without ANY of the segregations docker puts in place (this includes network segregation, PID segregation, etc)
